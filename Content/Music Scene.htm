        <h1>Music Scene</h1>
        <p>If you’re into music, especially southern rock, you’ll know Macon’s revolutionary music history. Macon is considered the birthplace of southern rock, so it’s only fitting that today’s music scene is quite vibrant. On just about every Friday and Saturday night you’ll find a handful of bands playing around downtown. The Hargray Capitol Theatre, Grant’s Lounge, and many other venues are the places to be to see great live music. The Robert Mcduffie Center For Strings is an organization run by Mercer University which often hosts classical music concerts. To get the full effect, be sure to take the Rock Candy Tour to learn about all of Macon’s legendary musical history. The Big House, The Otis Redding Foundation, and the Where Soul Lives museum are also terrific places to take in all of Macon’s rich music history. </p>
