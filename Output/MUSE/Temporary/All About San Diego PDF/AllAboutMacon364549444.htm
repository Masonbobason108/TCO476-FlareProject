        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>If it’s history you’re after, Macon is certainly worth visiting. One of Macon’s biggest pieces of history is the Ocmulgee National Monument. During the 18th century, the Creek Indians lived in this area, known as the Ocmulgee Old Fields. The Ocmulgee National Monument is a national park devoted to the history of the Southeastern Native American culture. The park features the preserved burial mounds as well a multitude of open fields and trails.</p>
        <p>Macon’s musical history is just as spectacular. Macon is known as the home of The Allman Brothers Band, Otis Redding, Little Richard, and Capricorn Records. Macon is also known as the birthplace of Southern Rock. In the 60s and 70s, Macon was a music hotbed for bands and artists. The music scene was booming and even contributing to social change. At the time, integration was beginning to make headway and music was the forefront. Black and white musicians were making music and performing together. You could say along with the revolutionary change in music, Macon also led to a better society.</p>
