                        <p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Whether you’re planning on visiting, or moving to Macon, we have everything you’ll need right here. Macon is a relatively average sized city, but has the heart and soul of a small town. There are around 150,000 citizens who live in Macon. If you still want the big city feel, Atlanta is only about an hour and a half drive north. There are also numerous restaurants and bars, some of which are quite popular. For instance, The Rookery, H&amp;H, Ocmulgee Brewpub, and others are well known for their quality food. On any given Friday or Saturday night you there will be live music in many locations downtown, most commonly on Cherry Street, which is the center of downtown.</p>

With the growth of these colleges, Macon has become known for its well educated graduates. It would be remiss if we didn’t mention Macon’s rich music history. A few of Macon’s claims to fame is that The Allman Brothers Band, Otis Redding, and Little Richard are from Macon. These artists, along with others, recorded and performed here in Macon and changed music forever. Macon not only has history in music, but many other aspects, such as black history.
