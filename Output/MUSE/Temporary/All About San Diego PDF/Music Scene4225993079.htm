        <p style="frame-break-before: auto;mc-short-line-loosen-end-length: 20;">If you’re into music, especially southern rock, you’ll know Macon’s revolutionary music history. Macon is considered the birthplace of 
		southern rock, so it’s only fitting that today’s music scene is quite vibrant. On just about every 
			Friday and Saturday night you’ll find a handful of bands playing around downtown. The Hargray Capitol Theatre, 
			Grant’s Lounge, and many other venues are the places to be to see great live music. The Robert Mcduffie Center 
			For Strings is an organization run by Mercer University which often hosts classical music concerts. To get the 
			full effect, be sure to take the Rock Candy Tour to learn about all of Macon’s legendary musical history. 
			The Big House, The Otis Redding Foundation, and the Where Soul Lives museum are also terrific places to take 
			in all of Macon’s rich music history.</p>
